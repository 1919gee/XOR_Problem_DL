# XOR_Problem_DL
The XOR problem is a classic problem in the field of artificial neural networks and deep learning. It's often used to illustrate the limitations of simple linear models and the power of nonlinear models like neural networks.

The XOR (exclusive OR) problem is a binary classification problem where the goal is to learn a mapping from two binary input values (0 or 1) to a binary output value (also 0 or 1) based on the following rules:

If both inputs are 0 or both are 1, the output should be 0.
If one input is 0 and the other is 1, the output should be 1.
